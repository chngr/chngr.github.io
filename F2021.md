<span class="subheading">An undergraduate seminar during the fall of 2021.</span>

How might one go about designing a useful measure of diversity for, say, an
ecological system? One approach is to begin with a set of desiderata, a list of
properties that any good measure of diversity ought to satisfy, and go about
constructing all measures that satisfy these properties. With enough properties,
it may be the case that the measure in question is essentially uniquely
determined.

This is the approach of our text, in which we will discover that any measure of
diversity satisfying a set of reasonable assumptions coming from ecological
principles is amongst a family of well-known diversity measures, the Hill
numbers. This in turn is a simple transformation of another well-known measure
of variety, entropy. As such, I hope our journey through this book will give
many different perspectives on the notion of entropy, and related concepts.

### Prerequisites, Format, Expectations, etc.

Each participant will give 2 talks over the course of the semester, during which
I hope one enjoys some interesting mathematics, as well as meditates on the art
of presenting and talking about mathematics. During the rest of the semester,
I hope that those that are not presenting will help form a lively and friendly
seminar environment, one in which all participants can feel comfortable to
discuss and learn in.
