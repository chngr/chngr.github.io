title: Integral p-adic Hodge Theory
heading: Integral \(p\)-adic Hodge Theory

<span class="subheading">A summer reading seminar co-organized by <a class="people" href="index.html">Raymond Cheng</a> and <a class="people" href="http://shizhang.li">Shizhang Li</a></span>

The aim of this seminar is to gain an understanding of the (relatively) recent
work of Bhatt--Morrow--Scholze on integral \\(p\\)-adic Hodge theory.

## References

The primary reference, of course, is the paper of Bhatt--Morrow--Scholze listed
below. Besides that, however, Bhatt and Morrow have each written additional
articles that explain specific aspects of the main paper.

  1. Bhargav Bhatt, Matthew Morrow, and Peter Scholze,
  [Integral \\(p\\)-adic Hodge theory][BMS].

  2. Bhargav Bhatt,
  [Specializing varieties and their cohomology from characteristic \\(0\\) to
  characteristic \\(p\\)][Bhatt].

  3. Matthew Morrow,
  [Notes on the \\(\\mathbf{A}\_{\\mathrm{inf}}\\) cohomology of Integral \\(p\\)-adic
  Hodge theory][Morrow].

## Schedule

We meet Thursdays in Mathematics Room 407 between 2:00PM and 3:30PM.
