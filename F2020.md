title: Indra's Pearls
heading: Indra's Pearls
subheading: An undergraduate seminar during the fall of 2020.
---

I can introduce this topic no better than the excerpt on the primary text
itself:

> Felix Klein, one of the great nineteenth-century geometers, discovered in
> mathematics an idea prefigured in Buddhist mythology: the heaven of Indra
> contained a net of pearls, each of which was reflected in its neighbour, so
> that the whole Universe was mirrored in each pearl.

This seminar is then a meander through the brilliant
[hyperbolic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry#/media/File:Rhombitriheptagonal_tiling.svg)
world of [Felix Klein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Klein).
With the aid of our computers, we will be able to marvel at the
[_mise en abyme_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mise_en_abyme) of [Indra's
Pearls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indra%27s_net).

### Prerequisites, Format, Expectations, etc.

Curiousity and excitement are basically the only requirements for this
seminar; mathematical notions will be discussed as they come up. Programming
experience is helpful but not essential: it will simply make our journey so
much more panoramic!

Beyond the mathematical content, I hope that the seminar will convey a sense
of how mathematical research is conducted via play and experimentation, and
also a feeling for how mathematics is communicated. I hope that the seminar
will be very interactive, with lots of participation from both speaker and
audience.

## Schedule

We meet online Fridays between 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM, New York time. Mostly,
there will be a [first]{.schedule-first} and [second]{.schedule-second} speaker,
each speaking for approximately an hour.
