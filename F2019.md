Classical [Galois Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois_theory) aimed to
study the solvability of polynomial equations by studying a certain symmetry
group associated with the equation. Famously, these ideas allowed
[Ruffini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paolo_Ruffini),
[Abel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niels_Henrik_Abel),
and, of course, [Galois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89variste_Galois) to
show that there cannot possibly be a closed-form solution to the general quintic
equation involving only radicals in the coefficients of the equation; moreover,
Galois identified exactly which quintics can be solved explicitly through
detailed consideration of the properties of the symmetry group.

Differential Galois Theory is to linear differential equations as Galois Theory
is to polynomial equations. The
[subject](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picard%E2%80%93Vessiot_theory) was
initiated by [Picard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89mile_Picard) and
[Vessiot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Vessiot) some 50 years after
Galois, and following its ancestor, remained obscure and difficult to understand
until later developments, notably 50 some-odd years later by our very own
[Ritt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Ritt) and
[Kolchin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellis_Kolchin). As before, the theory is
concerned with a certain symmetry group associated with a linear differential
equation, and by studying properties of this symmetry group, one can prove, for
example, that the equation \\(y' = x - y^2\\) cannot be solved in elementary
terms; equivalently, the function \\(e^{-x^2}\\) cannot be integrated in
elementary terms!

The approach that we will follow is a slightly more modern approach that
crucially uses the [Riemann--Hilbert
Correspondence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann%E2%80%93Hilbert_correspondence).
This allows us to realize differential Galois groups very geometrically as
coming from monodromy related to differential equations; we have come full
circle!

### Prerequisites, Format, Expectations, etc.

This seminar should be accessible to one with a good background in linear
algebra, some analysis, and basics of modern algebra.

Beyond the mathematical content, these seminars are really about communicating
mathematics. In particular, I think that the small seminar environment is a
perfect place to develop skills and a sense of comfort in speaking and
presenting mathematics. Thus the seminar consists mostly of lectures by the
participants. Moreover, this experience is a great place to think carefully
about how to explain mathematics to an audience.

there will be a first and second speaker, each speaking for approximately an
hour.
