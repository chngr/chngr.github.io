title: Arithmetic of Elliptic Curves
heading: Arithmetic of Elliptic Curves
subheading: An undergraduate seminar during the spring of 2020.
---

[Elliptic curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve) are, depending
on who you ask, either [breakfast item](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torus) or
solutions to equations of the form
\\[ y^2 = x^3 + ax + b. \\]
The focus of this seminar is the rich arithmetic theory of these curves, which
means that we are interested in finding solutions in which \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)
are rational numbers. For instance, a first question would be whether or not
there is at least one solution of the above equation in rational numbers? If
this is answered in the affirmative, then maybe we want to know how many
solutions are there. Perhaps there are infinitely many solutions, in which case
we might want to have a measure of the size. From another tack, we might wish to
know how to construction rational solutions to the above equation. And we can go
on!

The goal of this seminar is to get familiar with the basic notions around
elliptic curves and to play with their arithmetic, after which there are many
topics we can jump to: [modular forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_form),
[cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography),
a [Millennium Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birch_and_Swinnerton-Dyer_conjecture)...
It will be fun!

### Prerequisites, Format, Expectations, etc.

This seminar should be accessible to one with a good background in linear
algebra, some analysis, and basics of modern algebra.

Beyond the mathematical content, these seminars are really about communicating
mathematics. In particular, I think that the small seminar environment is a
perfect place to develop skills and a sense of comfort in speaking and
presenting mathematics. Thus the seminar consists mostly of lectures by the
participants. Moreover, this experience is a great place to think carefully
about how to explain mathematics to an audience.
