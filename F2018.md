title: Combinatorial Reciprocity Theorems
subtitle: An undergraduate seminar led by <a class="people" href="index.html">Raymond Cheng</a> during the fall of 2018.
---

A basic problem in combinatorics---in fact, probably in life!---is to count:
how many objects of a particular shape, perhaps limited by a parameter \\(n\\)?
Varying the parameter \\(n\\) gives a sequence of non-negative integers which
can be packaged into a counting function.
Remarkably often, these counting functions turn out to be restrictions of
polynomials, or other nice functions defined on the entire set of integers,
to the non-negative ones.
One might ask: do evaluations of the counting function at negative integers
mean something?
A combinatorial reciprocity theorem is an answer to such a question.

This seminar is an introduction to enumerative and geometric combinatorics,
through combinatorial reciprocity theorems.
We will discuss some gadgets and methods of modern algebraic combinatorics such
as partially ordered sets, Möbius functions, and generating functions.
Our main concrete objects of study are the classical players of discrete
geometry: polyhedra, polytopes, and hyperplane arrangements.

### Prerequisites, Format, Expectations, etc.

This seminar should be accessible to one with a good background in linear
algebra.

Beyond the mathematical content, these seminars are really about communicating
mathematics.
This encompasses two main things for me.
First, the small seminar environment is a perfect place to develop skills and a
sense of comfort in speaking and presenting mathematics.
Thus the seminar consists mostly of lectures by the attendees.
Second, through occasional problem sets, I would like to refine your
mathematical writing.

## References {#references}

Our primary reference is a beautiful new book by Mathias Beck and Raman Sanyal:

* M. Beck and R. Sanyal (2018),
[[Combinatorial Reciprocity Theorems][BS-CRT]]{.paper}.

The idea of a combinatorial reciprocity theorem was probably first formalized by
Richard Stanley in a 1974 paper where he thought deeply about certain algebraic
identites amongst counting functions.
His original paper is not an easy read, but it's good to know where your roots
lie.

[MR0411982](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/search/publdoc.html?&pg1=MR&s1=0411982){.MR}.

Along the way, we are going to pick up some tools from algebraic and enumerative
combinatorics.
A classic reference in this area is Stanley's books on enumerative
combinatorics, only the first of which should be necessary.

[MR2868112](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/search/publdoc.html?&pg1=MR&s1=2868112){.MR}.

A large part of our adventure will be centred around polytopes, triangulations,
and other topics in discrete geometry.
I think the delightful book by Mathias Beck and Sinai Robins on lattice point
enumeration and Ehrhart theory should suffice for most of our purposes.
