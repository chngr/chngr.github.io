Tilings, sometimes known as [tessellations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tessellation),
abound: look to
[nature](https://www.science.org/do/10.1126/science.aag0001/full/cc_sunflower_16x9.jpg),
[architecture](https://physicsworld.com/a/islamic-quasicrystals-predate-penrose-tiles/),
[art](https://mcescher.com/gallery/symmetry/), and
[video games](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/Typical_Tetris_Game.svg).
There are
[much](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/P5-type15-chiral_coloring.png)
[more](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/Penrose_Tiling_%28Rhombi%29.svg)
[exotic](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/Pinwheel_3.jpg)
tilings which, for example, are
[aperiodic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aperiodic_tiling).

Tilings are pretty. Tilings also naturally lead to many mathematically
interesting questions. For example:

  - Given a big shape, and a selection of small shapes,
  [is there](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutilated_chessboard_problem) a tiling?
  - If there is a tiling,
  [how many](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domino_tiling#Counting_tilings_of_regions)
  are there?
  - What does a random tiling
  [look like](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/Aztec_diamond%2C_n%3D50.jpg)?
  - What types of
  [symmetries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallpaper_group) do tilings admit?

And so forth! This seminar will touch on some of this vast topic of tilings.


### Prerequisites, Format, Expectations, etc.

Each participant will give 1 or 2 talks over the course of the semester, during
which I hope one enjoys some interesting mathematics, as well as meditates on
the art of presenting and talking about mathematics. During the rest of the
semester, I hope that those that are not presenting will help form a lively and
friendly seminar environment, one in which all participants can feel comfortable
to discuss and learn in.

## References

There are many possible topics in the mathematics of tilings to explore. What
follows is a sampling of possible topics and references for this seminar. This
list is by no means exhaustive, and I would encourage you to find something that
suits your taste!

* Federico Ardila and Richard P. Stanley (2005),
  [[Tilings][Stanley]]{.paper}.

This is a quick survey, aimed at a general audience, on the mathematics of
tilings. The text contains many references for further reading.

### Books

* Brank Grunbaum and Geoffrey C. Shephard (1987),
[[Tilings and Patterns][GS]]{.paper}.

This is perhaps the first textbook on the mathematics of tilings. It is full of
pictures and gives a rather comprehensive treatment of many topics around
tilings of the plane. Problems about tiling the plane are still topics of
[current research](https://www.quantamagazine.org/pentagon-tiling-proof-solves-century-old-math-problem-20170711/)!

* John H. Conway, Heidi Burgiel, Chaim Goodman-Strass (2008),
[[The Symmetries of Things][CBGS]]{.paper}.

This book is a more recent treatment about tilings, especially in regards to the
symmetries they admit. The first part of this book gives a pretty and
gentle classification of the possible symmetry groups of plane
tilings---otherwise known as crystallographic groups. The later chapters explore
more advanced topics involving group theory and
[hyperbolic tilings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_tilings_in_hyperbolic_plane).
It's a book full of pictures and ideas, and should be an absolute delight to
read.

* Solomon W. Golomb (1994),
[[Polynominoes: puzzles, problems, and packings][Golomb]]{.paper}.

Have you played [Tetris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris)? Or perhaps you
have packed a grocery bag. In any case, this is a game
of tiling by [tetromino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetromino). A
[polynomino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyomino) is like tetris-like blocks
of different sizes. You can now ask many questions about them, and this book is
a guide to some of the mathematics.

### Aperiodic Tilings

Aperiodic tilings are ones which do not admit translational symmetry. Before
reading anything, you can do a lot worse than taking a look at the following
gallery of
[substitution tilings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_tiling):

* Dirk Frettlöh, Franz Gähler, and Edmund Harriss,
[Tilings Encyclopedia](https://tilings.math.uni-bielefeld.de/).

One of the most well-known aperiodic tilings are the
[Penrose tilings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_tiling). Some things to
read around this include:

* Roger Penrose (1974),
[The role of aesthetics in pure and applied mathematical research]{.paper}.

* Roger Penrose (1979),
[[Pentaplexity: A Class of Non-Periodic Tilings of the Plane][Penrose:Penta]]{.paper}.

Since then, there are many construction methods for aperiodic tilings. Some
other interesting resources include:

* Robert Berger (1966),
[[The undecidability of the domino problem][Berger]]{.paper}.

* Charles Radin (1994),
[[The pinwheel tilings of the plane][Radin:Pinwheel]]{.paper}.

* Charles Radin (2021),
[[Conway and Aperiodic Tilings][Radin:Survey]]{.paper}.


### Tiling Invariants

John Horton Conway invented a fascinating group-theoretic method to prove
whether or not a region admits a tiling. Some basic references for this are the
papers:

* John H. Conway and Jeffrey C. Lagrais (1990),
[[Tiling with polynominoes and combinatorial group theory][CL]]{.paper}.

* William P. Thurston (1989),
[[Groups, tilings, and finite state automata][Thurston:Lectures]]{.paper}.

* William P. Thurston (1990),
[[Conway's Tiling Groups][Thurston]]{.paper}.

* Igor Pak (2000),
[[Tile Invariants: New Horizons][Pak]]{.paper}.

### Aztec Diamond

The Aztec diamond is like a pixellated diamond, see [this
picture](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/Diamant_azteque.svg).
Many questions about domino tilings of Aztec diamonds admit pretty solutions.
Some references on this topic might be:

[[Alternating-Sign Matrices and Domino Tilings (Part I)][EKLPI]]{.paper}.

* Noam Elkies, Greg Kuperberg, Micahel Larsen, and James Propp (1992),
