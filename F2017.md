<span class="subheading">An undergraduate seminar during the fall of 2017.</span>

The goal of this seminar is to understand the recent proof of Rota--Welsh
Conjecture due to Adiprasito--Huh--Katz.

Briefly, the Rota--Welsh Conjecture is a combinatorial conjecture that posits
that the coefficients of a certain
[polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matroid#Characteristic_polynomial)
associated with certain combinatorial objects, called
[matroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matroid),
form a
[log-concave sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithmically_concave_sequence).
Log-concavity of a sequence is a slight strengthening of unimodality of a
sequence, i.e. if the sequence first increases then decreases. The basic case to
keep in mind is that the coefficients of the
[chromatic polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_polynomial)
of a graph are log-concave.

The recent work of Adiprasito--Huh--Katz establishes the Rota--Welsh Conjecture
by developing a combinatorial
[Hodge theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodge_theory#Hodge_theory_for_complex_projective_varieties)
for matroids in general. Their methods, though inspired by algebraic geometric
considerations, are elementary in the sense that they do not need to directly
invoke the algebro-geometric muse.
