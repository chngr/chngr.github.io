<span class="subheading">An undergraduate seminar during the spring of 2021.</span>

[Origami/折り紙](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origami) is the art of paper
folding. With just a square piece of paper and straight folds, one can construct
an amazing variety of shapes and figures.

Beyond the visual art, origami is a wellspring for
[mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origami). For example,
viewing just the crease patterns left on a piece of paper, origami gives a
system of planar geometry that is reminiscent to [straightedge and
compass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straightedge_and_compass_construction)
geometry of the Greeks. Something that is rather amazing already is that
the geometry of origami is, in a precise sense, more expressive than the
geometry known to Euclid: one can
[double the cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubling_the_cube),
[trisect an angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_trisection), and
[construct regular heptagons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructible_polygon).

I hope this seminar serves as a mathematical
[shinrinyoku/森林浴](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_therapy), a pleasant
excursion out to experience some beautiful mathematics and art during this
peculiar time.

### Prerequisites, Format, Expectations, etc.

Curiousity and excitement are basically the only requirements for this
seminar; mathematical notions will be discussed as they come up. The goal of
this seminar is to learn some beautiful mathematics, and to have fun doing so.
Bonus for finding new friends and pets along the way.

Beyond the mathematical content, I hope that the seminar will convey a sense
of how mathematical research is conducted via play and experimentation, and
also a feeling for how mathematics is communicated. I hope that the seminar
will be very interactive, with lots of participation from both speaker and
audience.
