  title: Derived equivalence for elliptic K3 surfaces and Jacobians
  abstract: We present a detailed study of Fourier-Mukai partners of elliptic
    K3 surfaces. One way to produce Fourier-Mukai partners of elliptic K3
    surfaces is by taking Jacobians. We answer the question of whether every
    Fourier-Mukai partner is obtained in this way. This question was raised by
    Hassett and Tschinkel in 2015. We fully classify elliptic fibrations on
    Fourier-Mukai partners in terms of Hodge-theoretic data, similar to the
    Derived Torelli Theorem that describes Fourier-Mukai partners. This
    classification has an explicit computable form in Picard rank two, building
    on the work of Stellari and Van Geemen. We prove that for a large class of
    Picard rank 2 elliptic K3 surfaces all Fourier-Mukai partners are
    Jacobians. However, we also show that there exist many elliptic K3 surfaces
    with Fourier-Mukai partners which are not Jacobians of the original K3
    surface. This is joint work with Evgeny Shinder.

  title: "\\(q\\)-bic hypersurfaces"
  abstract: "Let’s count: \\(1\\), \\(2\\), \\(q+1\\). The eponymous objects
    are special projective hypersurfaces of degree \\(q+1\\), where \\(q\\) is
    a power of the positive ground field characteristic. This talk will sketch
    an analogy between the geometry of \\(q\\)-bic hypersurfaces and that of
    quadric and cubic hypersurfaces. For instance, the moduli spaces of linear
    spaces in \\(q\\)-bics are smooth and themselves have rich geometry. In the
    case of \\(q\\)-bic threefolds, I will describe an analogue of result of
    Clemens and Griffiths, which relates the intermediate Jacobian of the
    \\(q\\)-bic with the Albanese of its surface of lines."

  title: Irrationality of cubic threefolds in characteristic 2
  abstract: In 1972 Clemens and Griffiths gave a formidable proof that a
    smooth cubic threefold over C is irrational. The proof was soon after
    adapted to any algebraically closed field of characteristic not 2 using
    algebraic methods. I will finish the story by extending the proof to the
    case of characteristic 2. As arithmetic applications, we answer a question
    of Deligne regarding arithmetic Torelli maps and establish the Shafarevich
    conjecture for cubic threefolds over function fields of characteristic 2.

  title: Quadric bundles over smooth surfaces
  abstract: "For a flat quadric bundle of relative even dimension with fibers
    of corank at most 1, there is a well established relation between its
    derived category and its relative Hilbert scheme of maximal isotropic
    subspaces (or its relative moduli of spinor bundles). For a smooth
    \\(2m\\)-fold with the structure of a quadric bundle over a smooth surface,
    there is a finite number of fibers with corank 2 and this relation fails. I
    will discuss how to fix the relation in this case."

  title: Maximal linear spaces for pencils of quadrics and rationality
  abstract: "Over an arbitrary field \\(k\\) of odd characteristic, let \\(X\\)
    be a smooth complete intersection of two quadrics in
    \\(\\mathbf{P}^{2g+1}\\). For every \\(g\\) at least 2, we show that the
    existence of a \\((g-1)\\)-plane, defined over \\(k\\), on \\(X\\) may be
    characterized by \\(k\\)-rationality of a certain 3-dimensional subvariety
    of the Fano scheme of \\((g-2)\\)-planes on \\(X\\), generalizing the
    \\(g = 2\\) case due to Hassett–Tschinkel and Benoist–Wittenberg. We also
    present a related result on \\(k\\)-rationality of the Fano schemes of
    non-maximal linear spaces on \\(X\\). This is joint work in progress with
    Lena Ji."

  title: A note on spherical bundles on K3 surfaces
  abstract: "Let \\(S\\) be a K3 surface with the bounded derived category
    \\(\\mathrm{D}^b(S)\\). Let \\(E\\) be a spherical object in
    \\(\\mathrm{D}^b(S)\\). Then there always exists a non-zero object \\(F\\)
    satisfying \\(\\mathrm{RHom}(E,F)=0\\). Further, there exists a spherical
    bundle \\(E\\) on some K3 surfaces that is unstable with respect to all
    polarization on \\(S\\). Also we “count”  spherical bundles with a fixed
    Mukai vector. These provide (partial) answers to some questions of
    Huybrechts. This is a joint work with Chunyi Li."

  title: Zeta function of the K3 category of a cubic
  abstract:  "We study the arithmetic of the K3 category associated to a cubic
    fourfold over a non-algebraically closed field \\(k\\). We start by
    constructing the Mukai structure of this K3 category with a natural action
    of Galois. For \\(k\\) a finite field, this lets us define the zeta
    function of a K3 category, an invariant under FM-equivalence of K3
    categories. We provide a characterization of those cubic fourfolds whose K3
    category has zeta function arising from a K3 surface defined over \\(k\\).
    One interesting outcome is that the zeta function does not always detect
    the geometricity of the K3 category. This is joint work with Asher Auel."

  title: On the boundedness of elliptic Calabi-Yau threefolds
  abstract: "In this talk, we will discuss the boundedness of Calabi-Yau
    threefolds admitting an elliptic fibration. First, we will review the
    notion of boundedness in birational geometry and its weak forms. Then, we
    will switch focus to Calabi-Yau varieties and discuss how the
    Kawamata-Morrison cone conjecture comes in the picture when studying
    boundedness properties for this class of varieties. To conclude, we will
    see how this circle of ideas applies to the case of elliptic Calabi-Yau
    threefolds. This talk is based on work joint with C.D. Hacon and R. Svaldi."

  title: "Geometry of moduli of t-connections"
  abstract: "I will review some of my recent work on moduli spaces of Higgs
  bundles, of connections and of t-connections (which subsums both). These
  moduli spaces are objects of interest in the Non Abelian Hodge Theory of
  projective manifolds--warning: I will only discuss the case of curves--over
    the complex numbers and they have been intensively studied in the last
    thirty plus years. The situation over fields of positive characteristic is
    less explored and has also become the focus of what people call NAHT in
    characteristic p.  While the moduli spaces  of Higgs bundles and of
    connections are homeomorphic over the complex numbers, the situation over
    fields of positive characteristic is less clear. I will focus on explaining
    how a suitable compactification of these moduli spaces allows to bypass the
    lack of a homeomorphism to yield a canonical isomorphism of cohomology
    rings. Along the way, I will discuss some of the new phenomena, absent over
    the complex numbers, that emerge in positive characteristic. I will be
    short on technical details and my plan is to make the talk accessible to
    non-experts. For example, in illustrating the compactification technique, I
    will use as a guide the Ehresmann Lemma from differential topology. The
    talk contains some joint work with  Siqing Zhang and with Davesh Maulik,
    Junliang Shen and Siqing Zhang."
