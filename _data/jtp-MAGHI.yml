  title: Derived equivalence for elliptic K3 surfaces and Jacobians
  abstract: We present a detailed study of Fourier-Mukai partners of elliptic
    K3 surfaces. One way to produce Fourier-Mukai partners of elliptic K3
    surfaces is by taking Jacobians. We answer the question of whether every
    Fourier-Mukai partner is obtained in this way. This question was raised by
    Hassett and Tschinkel in 2015. We fully classify elliptic fibrations on
    Fourier-Mukai partners in terms of Hodge-theoretic data, similar to the
    Derived Torelli Theorem that describes Fourier-Mukai partners. This
    classification has an explicit computable form in Picard rank two, building
    on the work of Stellari and Van Geemen. We prove that for a large class of
    Picard rank 2 elliptic K3 surfaces all Fourier-Mukai partners are
    Jacobians. However, we also show that there exist many elliptic K3 surfaces
    with Fourier-Mukai partners which are not Jacobians of the original K3
    surface. This is joint work with Evgeny Shinder.

  title: "\\(q\\)-bic hypersurfaces"
  abstract: "Let’s count: \\(1\\), \\(2\\), \\(q+1\\). The eponymous objects
    are special projective hypersurfaces of degree \\(q+1\\), where \\(q\\) is
    a power of the positive ground field characteristic. This talk will sketch
    an analogy between the geometry of \\(q\\)-bic hypersurfaces and that of
    quadric and cubic hypersurfaces. For instance, the moduli spaces of linear
    spaces in \\(q\\)-bics are smooth and themselves have rich geometry. In the
    case of \\(q\\)-bic threefolds, I will describe an analogue of result of
    Clemens and Griffiths, which relates the intermediate Jacobian of the
    \\(q\\)-bic with the Albanese of its surface of lines."

  title: Irrationality of cubic threefolds in characteristic 2
  abstract: In 1972 Clemens and Griffiths gave a formidable proof that a
    smooth cubic threefold over C is irrational. The proof was soon after
    adapted to any algebraically closed field of characteristic not 2 using
    algebraic methods. I will finish the story by extending the proof to the
    case of characteristic 2. As arithmetic applications, we answer a question
    of Deligne regarding arithmetic Torelli maps and establish the Shafarevich
    conjecture for cubic threefolds over function fields of characteristic 2.

  title: Quadric bundles over smooth surfaces
  abstract: "For a flat quadric bundle of relative even dimension with fibers
    of corank at most 1, there is a well established relation between its
    derived category and its relative Hilbert scheme of maximal isotropic
    subspaces (or its relative moduli of spinor bundles). For a smooth
    \\(2m\\)-fold with the structure of a quadric bundle over a smooth surface,
    there is a finite number of fibers with corank 2 and this relation fails. I
    will discuss how to fix the relation in this case."

  title: Maximal linear spaces for pencils of quadrics and rationality
  abstract: "Over an arbitrary field \\(k\\) of odd characteristic, let \\(X\\)
    be a smooth complete intersection of two quadrics in
    \\(\\mathbf{P}^{2g+1}\\). For every \\(g\\) at least 2, we show that the
    existence of a \\((g-1)\\)-plane, defined over \\(k\\), on \\(X\\) may be
    characterized by \\(k\\)-rationality of a certain 3-dimensional subvariety
    of the Fano scheme of \\((g-2)\\)-planes on \\(X\\), generalizing the
    \\(g = 2\\) case due to Hassett–Tschinkel and Benoist–Wittenberg. We also
    present a related result on \\(k\\)-rationality of the Fano schemes of
    non-maximal linear spaces on \\(X\\). This is joint work in progress with
    Lena Ji."
