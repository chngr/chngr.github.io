  title: Derived equivalence for elliptic K3 surfaces and Jacobians
  abstract: We present a detailed study of Fourier-Mukai partners of elliptic
    K3 surfaces. One way to produce Fourier-Mukai partners of elliptic K3
    surfaces is by taking Jacobians. We answer the question of whether every
    Fourier-Mukai partner is obtained in this way. This question was raised by
    Hassett and Tschinkel in 2015. We fully classify elliptic fibrations on
    Fourier-Mukai partners in terms of Hodge-theoretic data, similar to the
    Derived Torelli Theorem that describes Fourier-Mukai partners. This
    classification has an explicit computable form in Picard rank two, building
    on the work of Stellari and Van Geemen. We prove that for a large class of
    Picard rank 2 elliptic K3 surfaces all Fourier-Mukai partners are
    Jacobians. However, we also show that there exist many elliptic K3 surfaces
    with Fourier-Mukai partners which are not Jacobians of the original K3
    surface. This is joint work with Evgeny Shinder.
