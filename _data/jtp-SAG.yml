  title: Fully faithful functors and dimension
  abstract: Can one embed the derived category of a higher dimensional variety
    into the derived category of a lower dimensional variety? The expected
    answer was no. We give a simple proof and prove new cases of a conjecture
    of Orlov along the way.

  title: Cubic fourfolds and K3 surfaces with large automorphism groups
  abstract: Relations between cubic fourfolds and K3 surfaces are described by
    Hodge theory and derived categories. Using Hodge theory and derived
    categories, we can show that cubic fourfolds and associated K3 surfaces
    share their symmetries, which are related with Mathieu groups and Conway
    groups. In this talk, we find pairs of a cubic fourfold and a K3 surface
    sharing large symplectic automorphism groups via Bridgeland stability
    conditions on K3 surfaces.
