  title: Fully faithful functors and dimension
  abstract: Can one embed the derived category of a higher dimensional variety
    into the derived category of a lower dimensional variety? The expected
    answer was no. We give a simple proof and prove new cases of a conjecture
    of Orlov along the way.
