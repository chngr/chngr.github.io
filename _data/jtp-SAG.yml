  title: Fully faithful functors and dimension
  abstract: Can one embed the derived category of a higher dimensional variety
    into the derived category of a lower dimensional variety? The expected
    answer was no. We give a simple proof and prove new cases of a conjecture
    of Orlov along the way.

  title: Cubic fourfolds and K3 surfaces with large automorphism groups
  abstract: Relations between cubic fourfolds and K3 surfaces are described by
    Hodge theory and derived categories. Using Hodge theory and derived
    categories, we can show that cubic fourfolds and associated K3 surfaces
    share their symmetries, which are related with Mathieu groups and Conway
    groups. In this talk, we find pairs of a cubic fourfold and a K3 surface
    sharing large symplectic automorphism groups via Bridgeland stability
    conditions on K3 surfaces.

  title: Non-commutative deformations and contractibility of rational curves
  abstract: "When can we contract a rational curve \\(C\\)? The situation is
    much more complicated for threefolds than it is for surfaces: Jimenez gives
      examples of (-3,1)-rational curves neither contract nor move. Their
      behaviour is controlled by the functor of non-commutative deformations of
      \\(C\\), which conjecturally controls exactly their contractibility. I
      will report on work in progress with M. Wemyss, and reinterpret some of
      Jimenez's examples in terms of non-commutative deformations."

  title: "Towards curve counting on the classifying stack \\(B\\mathrm{GL}_n\\)"
  abstract: "In this talk I will describe a version of stable maps into a
    quotient stack \\([Z/\\mathrm{GL}_N]\\), where \\(Z\\) is a projective
    variety with an action of the general linear group \\(\\mathrm{GL}_N\\). If
    time allows, I will also update on the ongoing piece of the story with
    marked points, which involves some surprises such as the inclusion of a
    notion of `orientation' for the markings in order to compactify the
    evaluation morphisms and recover reasonable gluing morphisms. This talk is
    based on joint work in progress with Daniel Halpern-Leistner."

  title: "Isotrivial Lagrangian fibrations of compact hyper-KÃ¤hler manifolds"
  abstract: "I will present a recent exploration of the geometry of isotrivial
    Lagrangian fibrations conducted with Y. Kim and R. Laza. We show that the
    smooth fiber of such a fibration is isogenous to the power of an elliptic
    curve. Moreover, we introduce a dichotomy arising from the Kodaira
    dimension of the minimal Galois cover of the base trivializing monodromy.
    We also classify up to birational equivalence isotrivial fibrations with a
    section in the case where this cover has Kodaira dimension 0."

  title: "The automorphism group of the moduli space of \\(G\\)-bundles over a curve"
  abstract: "For any almost-simple group \\(G\\) over an algebraically closed
    field \\(k\\) characteristic zero, we describe the automorphism group of
    the moduli space of semistable \\(G\\)-bundles over a curve of genus at
    least 4. The result is achieved by studying the singular fibers of the
    Hitchin fibration. Time permitting, we also provide a proof of a
    Torelli-type theorem for these moduli spaces."
