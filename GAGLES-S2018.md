title: Topics on Abelian Varieties
heading: Topics on Abelian Varieties
---
<span class="subheading">An episode of <a title="Graduate Algebraic Geometry LEarning Seminar">GAGLeS</a> organized by <a href="index.html">Raymond Cheng</a> during the spring of 2018.</span>

The first half of this seminar aims to develop the basic theory of abelian
varieties, mainly following Mumford's beautiful book mentioned below.
The second half of this seminar is a scattering of topics around the geometric
theory of abelian varieties.

## References

Abelian varieties are heavily studied objects and there are many great
references for the subject. Some notable general references on abelian
varieties include:

  1. David Mumford,
  [Abelian Varieties][Mumford].
  <span class="paper-description">
  This book is a beautiful classic. Mumford treats abelian varieties
  first from a complex analytic point of view, before moving onto an
  old-style variety-theoretic manner, before finally dealing with the
  modern scheme-theoretic language.
  </span>

  2. Christina Birkenhake and Herbert Lange,
  [Complex abelian varieties][BL].
  <span class="paper-description">
  If there is something about complex analytic abelian varieties you would
  like to know, this book probably contains it. In particular, this book is a
  rich source on theta functions.
  </span>

  3. Bas Edixhoven, Gerard van der Geer, and Ben Moonen,
  [Abelian Varieties][EvdGM].
  <span class="paper-description">
  This is book-in-progress which, along with the basic theory of abelian
  varieties, touches on many interesting arithmetic topics. See also Ben
  Moonen's [research page](https://www.math.ru.nl/~bmoonen/research.html) for
  (possibly) updated veresions of chapters of this book.

  4. James S. Milne,
  [Abelian Varieties][Milne].
  <span class="paper-description">
  Notes on abelian varieties by Milne. I don't think any more has to be
  said.
  </span>

  5. Brian Conrad with notes by Tony Feng,
  [Math 249C: Abelian Varieties][Conrad].
  <span class="paper-description">
  These are live-\\(\\TeX\\)ed notes for a topics course on abelian varieties
  taught by Brian Conrad at Stanford in 2015.
  </span>

  6. Bhargav Bhatt with notes by Matt Stevenson,
  [Math 731: Topics in Algebraic Geometry I â€“ Abelian Varieties][Bhatt],
  <span class="paper-description">
  These are notes from a topics course on abelian varieties taught by Bhargav
  Bhatt at the University of Michigan during the Fall of 2017. Beyond the basic
  theory of abelian varieties, these notes discuss derived properties of abelian
  varieties, such as the Fourier--Mukai equivalence between the derived category
  of an abelain variety and its dual.
