## Expository

1. <div class="paper">
<div class="paper-title">[Projectivity of moduli of curves](/assets/mgbar.pdf)</a></div>
<p class="paper-description">
This is a draft of an exposition of Kollár's proof of the projectivity
of the moduli space of stable curves. This was started at the
[Stacks Project Workshop](https://stacks.github.io/2017/)
during August of 2017 together with
[Yordanka Kovacheva](http://math.uchicago.edu/~ykovach/){.people},
[Carl Lian](http://www.math.columbia.edu/~clian/){.people},
[Monica Marinescu](http://math.columbia.edu/~marinescu/){.people}, and
[Takumi Murayama](https://web.math.princeton.edu/~takumim/){.people},
with guidance from [Davesh Maulik](http://www-math.mit.edu/~maulik/){.people}.
The source code for this project is available
<a href="https://github.com/chngr/mgbar-proj">here</a>.

2. <div class="paper">
<div class="paper-title">Theorem of the Base</div>
<p class="paper-description">
This is a project started at the
[Stacks Project Workshop](https://stacks.github.io/) during August of 2020
together with
[Lena Ji](https://web.math.princeton.edu/~lji/){.people},
[Matt Larson](https://stanford.edu/~mwlarson/){.people},
[Noah Olander](http://math.columbia.edu/~nolander/){.people}, and
[Remy van Dobben de Bruyn](https://web.math.princeton.edu/~rdobben/){.people}.
We give an exposition of the Theorem of the Base, which states that the
Néron--Severi group of a proper scheme over a field is a finitely generated
abelian group. The document is still in quite a rough form, but it is available
upon request.
