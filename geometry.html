            <h1>Geometry Working Seminar 2016</h1>

            The Geometry Working Seminar, for the Spring of 2016, is a student
            run seminar <b>Mondays from 1130 to 1300 at MC 5403</b> and
            <b>Thursdays from 1130 to 1300 at MC 5403</b>. The seminar is a
            friendly forum to discuss and explore various facets of geometry.

                  <b>Calibrations</b><br/>
                  We will discuss minimal submanifolds and show that the
                  condition of being minimal amounts to the existence of a
                  solution to a certain second order non-linear PDE. This will
                  provide some motivation for defining calibrated submanifolds,
                  as they are automatically minimal and their existence depends
                  on solving a first order PDE as opposed to a second order
                  one. In conclusion, we will discuss how the real and
                  imaginary parts of the complex volume form on a Calabi-Yau
                  manifold are calibrations before defining Special Lagrangian
                  submanifolds and stating a simplified version of the SYZ
                  conjecture.

                  <b>On the Kobayshi-Hitchin correspondence</b><br/>
                  The discussion will be on a correspondence between
                  holomorphic structures and Hermitian-Einstein connections. We
                  will briefly introduce the necessary background from complex
                  geometry and geometric analysis as we go. The hope is to see
                  some moduli space consturctions so we can picture this
                  correspondence in a real analytic framework.

                  <b>Crash Course on Spectral Sequences</b><br/>
                  The goal is to introduce spectral sequences assuming only
                  basic algebraic topology. I'll outline derived categories
                  just so we can see how spectral sequences are really just us
                  "working in coordinates" wrt operations on derived functors.
                  Specifically we'll look at the Grothendieck spectral sequence
                  coming from the composition of derived functors. Then we'll
                  plug in specific functors. If time permits we'll construct
                  the exact sequence of low degree terms associated to any
                  spectral sequence. Be prepared for a lot of indices and
                  bashing (sorry!).

                  <b>What is a... Deformation?</b><br/>
                  I shall use this talk as an excuse to figure out precisely
                  how or why deformation theory is useful in geometry and the
                  theory of moduli. Thus I want to present some examples of
                  geometric consequences one can extract from deformation
                  theory. I hope to leave this seminar with some example
                  questions for which this theory can tell us something.

                  <b>Spectral Sequences, Continued</b><br/>
                  We'll prove the isomorphism of the composition of derived
                  functors before diving back into the construction of spectral
                  sequences. We'll construct the Grothendieck spectral sequence
                  for the composition of derived functors in some detail, and
                  then apply it to a few functors. Then we'll look at an exact
                  sequence of low degree terms coming from any spectral
                  sequence.
