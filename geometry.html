            <h1>Geometry Working Seminar 2016</h1>

            The Geometry Working Seminar, for the Spring of 2016, is a student
            run seminar <b>Mondays from 1130 to 1300 at MC 5403</b> and
            <b>Thursdays from 1130 to 1300 at MC 5403</b>. The seminar is a
            friendly forum to discuss and explore various facets of geometry.

                  <b>Calibrations</b><br/>
                  We will discuss minimal submanifolds and show that the
                  condition of being minimal amounts to the existence of a
                  solution to a certain second order non-linear PDE. This will
                  provide some motivation for defining calibrated submanifolds,
                  as they are automatically minimal and their existence depends
                  on solving a first order PDE as opposed to a second order
                  one. In conclusion, we will discuss how the real and
                  imaginary parts of the complex volume form on a Calabi-Yau
                  manifold are calibrations before defining Special Lagrangian
                  submanifolds and stating a simplified version of the SYZ
                  conjecture.

                  <b>On the Kobayshi-Hitchin correspondence</b><br/>
                  The discussion will be on a correspondence between
                  holomorphic structures and Hermitian-Einstein connections. We
                  will briefly introduce the necessary background from complex
                  geometry and geometric analysis as we go. The hope is to see
                  some moduli space consturctions so we can picture this
                  correspondence in a real analytic framework.

                  <b>What is a... Deformation?</b><br/>
                  I shall use this talk as an excuse to figure out precisely
                  how or why deformation theory is useful in geometry and the
                  theory of moduli. Thus I want to present some examples of
                  geometric consequences one can extract from deformation
                  theory. I hope to leave this seminar with some example
                  questions for which this theory can tell us something.
