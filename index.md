I am a fifth year mathematics graduate student at
[Columbia University](http://math.columbia.edu).
I have the pleasure and privilege to converse regularly with
[[Aise Johan de Jong](http://math.columbia.edu/~dejong)]{.people}.
Geometry fascinates me, with algebraic methods my preferred means of exploration.
In particular, I think a lot about rational curves, rationality problems, and
geometry in positive characteristic.

### Current Projects
During the Fall of 2020, I am:

- leading an undergraduate seminar on [Indra's Pearls](F2020.html);
- giving a
  [talk](http://www.ams.org/meetings/sectional/2278_progfull.html) at the Fall
  Eastern Sectional Meeting of the AMS on October 4;
- giving a
  [talk](https://sites.google.com/view/agsags/calendar) in the American
  Graduate Student Algebraic Geometry Seminar on November 11; and
- thinking about a peculiar Artin--Schreier covering of surfaces I found, in
  hopes of computing some cohomology!
