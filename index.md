I am a sixth year mathematics graduate student at
[Columbia University](http://math.columbia.edu).
I have the pleasure and privilege to converse regularly with
[[Aise Johan de Jong](http://math.columbia.edu/~dejong)]{.people}.
Geometry fascinates me, with algebraic methods my preferred means of exploration.
In particular, I think a lot about rational curves, rationality problems, and
geometry in positive characteristic.

### Current Projects
During the Fall of 2021, I am:

- writing about the geometry of \\(q\\)-bic hypersurfaces. If you are
interested, take a look at a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xx6MBSB1BY)
I gave on this during the summer!
- leading an Undergraduate Seminar on [Entropy and Diversity](F2021.html).
