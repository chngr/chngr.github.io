I am a fourth year mathematics graduate student at
[Columbia University](http://math.columbia.edu).
I have the pleasure and privilege to converse regularly with
[[Aise Johan de Jong](http://math.columbia.edu/~dejong)]{.people}.
Geometry fascinates me, with algebraic methods my preferred means of exploration.
In particular, I think a lot about rational curves, rationality problems, and
geometry in positive characteristic.

### Current Projects
During the Fall of 2019, I am:

- leading an undergraduate seminar on [Differential Galois Theory](F2019.html);
- working on a paper about the derived category of certain double quartic
  fivefolds with [Huachen Chen](https://sites.google.com/view/huachen/){.people},
  [Tony Feng](https://www.mit.edu/~fengt/){.people},
  [Alex Perry](https://math.columbia.edu/~aperry/){.people},
  and [Xiaolei Zhao](https://sites.google.com/site/xiaoleizhaoswebsite/){.people}.
  It's almost done and sort of fun; stay tuned!
- working on another paper about a family of varieties that look like orthogonal
  Grassmannian in positive characteristic: they are pretty weird and awesome!
