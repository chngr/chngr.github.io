I am a fourth year mathematics graduate student at
[Columbia University](http://math.columbia.edu).
I have the pleasure and privilege to converse regularly with
[[Aise Johan de Jong](http://math.columbia.edu/~dejong)]{.people}.
Geometry fascinates me, with algebraic methods my preferred means of exploration.
In particular, I think a lot about rational curves, rationality problems, and
geometry in positive characteristic.

### Current Projects
During the Fall of 2019, I am:

- leading an undergraduate seminar on (tentatively) [Differential Galois
  Theory](F2019.html);
- giving a talk in the Columbia [Undergraduate Mathematics
  Society](http://math.columbia.edu/~ums/) at 7:30 PM on September 11.
