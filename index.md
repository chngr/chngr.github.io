I am a fifth year mathematics graduate student at
[Columbia University](http://math.columbia.edu).
I have the pleasure and privilege to converse regularly with
[[Aise Johan de Jong](http://math.columbia.edu/~dejong)]{.people}.
Geometry fascinates me, with algebraic methods my preferred means of exploration.
In particular, I think a lot about rational curves, rationality problems, and
geometry in positive characteristic.

### Current Projects
During the Spring of 2021, I am:

- leading an undergraduate seminar on [Origami](S2021.html); and
- thinking about \\(q\\)-bic surfaces in positive characteristic!

Recently, I also thought about negative curves in rational surfaces in positive
characteristic with
[[Remy van Dobben de Bruyn](https://web.math.princeton.edu/~rdobben/)]{.people};
check it out [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02172)!
