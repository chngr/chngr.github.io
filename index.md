I am a postdoctoral
[Humboldt Research Fellow](https://www.humboldt-foundation.de/en/) based at the
[Institute of Algebraic Geometry](https://www.iag.uni-hannover.de/en/) within
[Leibniz Universität Hannover](https://www.uni-hannover.de/en/).
Geometry fascinates me, with algebraic methods my preferred means of
exploration. In particular, I think a lot about rational curves,
rationality problems, and geometry in positive characteristic.

### Current Projects
During the Spring of 2024, I am:

-   thinking about unirationality of a large class of high degree hypersurfaces
    in positive characteristic. These are related to the \\(q\\)-bic
    hypersurfaces that feature in [this](/assets/qbic-fanos.pdf) and
    [this](/assets/qbic-threefolds.pdf) paper; also take a look at this
    [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xx6MBSB1BY) I gave a while ago!
-   thinking about quadric bundles with
   {% include person.html person=site.data.people.noah_olander %}!
