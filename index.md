I am a postdoctoral
[Humboldt Research Fellow](https://www.humboldt-foundation.de/en/) based at the
[Institute of Algebraic Geometry](https://www.iag.uni-hannover.de/en/) within
[Leibniz Universität Hannover](https://www.uni-hannover.de/en/).
Geometry fascinates me, with algebraic methods my preferred means of
exploration. In particular, I think a lot about rational curves,
rationality problems, and geometry in positive characteristic.

### Current Projects
During the Autumn of 2023, I am:

-   visiting the Hausdorff Research Institute for Mathematics as part of the
    Junior Trimester Program in Algebraic Geometry. Please visit
    [this page](/jtp-2023) for more information.
-   writing about the geometry of \\(q\\)-bic threefolds. Take a look at the
    accompanying [paper](/assets/qbic-fanos.pdf) and this
    [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xx6MBSB1BY) I gave a while ago on
    the subject!
-   thinking about quadric surface bundles in characteristic \\(2\\) with
   {% include person.html person=site.data.people.noah_olander %}!
