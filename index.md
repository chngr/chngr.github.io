I am a fourth year mathematics graduate student at
[Columbia University](http://math.columbia.edu).
I have the pleasure and privilege to converse regularly with
[[Aise Johan de Jong](http://math.columbia.edu/~dejong)]{.people}.
Geometry fascinates me, with algebraic methods my preferred means of exploration.
In particular, I think a lot about rational curves, rationality problems, and
geometry in positive characteristic.

### Current Projects
During the Spring of 2020, I am:

- leading an undergraduate seminar on [The Arithmetic of Elliptic Curves](S2020.html);
- giving a
  [talk](https://research.math.osu.edu/arithgeoseminar/ArithGeomSeminar.html) at
  The Ohio State University on February 25: come hang out!
- attending [AGNES](http://www.agneshome.org/stony-brook-2020) at Stony Brook
  between March 27 and March 29: see you there!
- thinking about conic bundles and some positive characteristic analogues of
  them, Deligne--Lusztig theory, and more around the geometry of rational curves
  in positive characteristic; let's talk!
