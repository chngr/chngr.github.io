I am a postdoctoral fellow at the
[Institute of Algebraic Geometry](https://www.iag.uni-hannover.de/en/) within
[Leibniz Universität Hannover](https://www.uni-hannover.de/en/).
Geometry fascinates me, with algebraic methods my preferred means of
exploration. In particular, I think a lot about rational curves,
rationality problems, and geometry in positive characteristic.

### Current Projects
During the Winter of 2023, I am:

-   writing about \\(q\\)-bic hypersurfaces and their Fano schemes. Take a look
    at my [thesis](https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/doi/10.7916/4gba-xx11)
    and this [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xx6MBSB1BY) I gave a while
    ago on the subject!
