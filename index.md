I am a postdoctoral fellow at the
[Institute of Algebraic Geometry](https://www.iag.uni-hannover.de/en/) within
[Liebniz Universität Hannover](https://www.uni-hannover.de/en/).
Geometry fascinates me, with algebraic methods my preferred means of
exploration. In particular, I think a lot about rational curves,
rationality problems, and geometry in positive characteristic.

### Current Projects
During the Spring of 2022, I am:

- writing about the geometry of \\(q\\)-bic hypersurfaces. If you are
  interested, take a look at a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xx6MBSB1BY)
  I gave on this during the summer!
- I spoke about \\(q\\)-bic hypersurfaces in the [Moduli Across the
  Pandemic](https://sites.google.com/bc.edu/map/home) online seminar on January
  29; you can see the video [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16rEanN-KW_zDwfMAnK03n4e-3mOmcNfL/view?usp=sharing)!
- leading an Undergraduate Seminar on [Tilings](S2022.html).
